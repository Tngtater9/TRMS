# Tuition Reimbursement Management System

## Project Description

Tuition Reimbursement Management System is a full-stack web application that allows employees to submit requests for reimbursements for courses, events, and certifications. These requests can then be approved or rejected by the employee's direct supervisor, department head, and a benefits coordinator while the employee is able to track the status of their requests.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Typescript 
* Express
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS
* DynamoDB

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* As a user, I can create, view, edit, and delete reimbursement cases.
* As the system, it can update cases to urgent or reject them if they are past the cut off date.
* As management, I can grade and approve reimbursement cases.

To-do list:
* Improve UI, i.e. providing a view all cases regardless of status
* Provided more user friendly error messages

                PORT = <Port you want the server to run on>
3. `npm install --save`
4. Configure AWS with access key and secret key

6. While in server folder `npm start`
7. While in client folder `npm start`
